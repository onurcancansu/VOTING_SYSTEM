**Features**
ERC20 Compatibility: The MyGov governance token contract supports all standard ERC20 functions in addition to the specific interface functions outlined in Table 1.

Transactional Activities: The system allows three transactional activities: donation to MyGov, survey services, and project proposal submission, voting, and funding.

Membership Status: Any individual who owns at least 1 MyGov token becomes a MyGov member.

Member Activities: Members can participate in donation, survey services, and project proposal submission, voting, and funding.

Open Activity: Anyone can donate to MyGov (activity i) without needing to be a member.

Get Information Functions: Anyone, whether a member or not, can call the get information functions. View functions are open to everyone, allowing access to information without membership requirements.

Project Proposal Submission: Submitting a project proposal incurs a cost of 5 MyGov tokens and 0.1 Ether.

Survey Submission: Submitting a survey requires 2 MyGov tokens and 0.04 Ether.

Token Supply: The total supply of MyGov tokens is fixed at 10 million.

Donations: Donations can be made using ethers or MyGov tokens only. Winning project proposals can receive grants in ethers. MyGov tokens are distributed via a faucet function.

Faucet Function: MyGov tokens are distributed through a faucet function, providing 1 token per address. Once an address has obtained a token, it cannot receive additional tokens from the faucet.

Voting and Delegation: Each member can give one vote per proposal. Members also have the option to delegate their vote. Once a member has voted or delegated their vote, their MyGov balance cannot be reduced to zero until the voting deadlines.

**Usage**
Ensure you have an Ethereum wallet that supports ERC20 tokens.

Obtain MyGov tokens by participating in the faucet function or by purchasing them from exchanges.

Use the wallet to interact with the Blockchain Voting System, such as donating to MyGov, submitting surveys, and participating in project proposal voting and funding.

Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on interacting with the specific functions and workflows.

Feel free to explore the functionalities of the Blockchain Voting System, contribute to the decision-making processes, and participate in the governance of the platform.
